In disas main we can see call to auth function.
If value returned from auth is equal to 1 we call system("/bin/sh").
Looking at auth function we see comparison of input and local variable. If we make a breakpoint inside auth function
it is possible to see the password.
We need to go step by step and set breakpoints
b *auth + 114
set $eax=1
b *auth + 286
then we can look for our pass in ebp -0x10
same user === same pass

user = aaaaaa
