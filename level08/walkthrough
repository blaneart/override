Running executable level08 demonstrates that it creates exact copy of 
file that is receives as a first argument to ./backups folder. 
To create backup file program concatinats argv with string "./backups". However,
It concatenates only 89 characters. We can add 89 characters and then add relative path
to /home/users/level09/.pass so we cat create readable .pass file in ./backups. 
We also need to pass filename for backup file to be created with this name and it should be the same as folder inside user directory.
That's why we also need to put backups between relative paths.
Exploit looks like this:

./level08 "./././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././././backups/../../level09/.pass"
