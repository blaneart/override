Disas main shows that we wait for integer input and send it with 0x1337d00d as the arguments to test function.
In test function we substruct value of our input integer from 0x1337d00d. The result we compare with 21(0x15).
 If result of substraction is bigger than 21 we call decrypt() with rand() as an argument. Else we shift left by 2
 and add 0x80489f0 to the result of substruction. So we need to test 21 values.
The result of this operation is going to be the address that we call as our instruction. Correct input gives us 
0x8048a38 that stores 0x08048816 address (test + 207).
